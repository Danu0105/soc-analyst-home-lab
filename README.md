# :shield: Home SOC Lab Project

# :pushpin: Project Overview

Built a Security Operations Center (SOC) lab environment to simulate real-world cyber attacks and perform log analysis using SIEM.

# :desktop_computer: Lab Architecture

Tools Used:
- Virtualization: VirtualBox
- Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
- Target Machine: Metasploitable 2
- SIEM: Splunk
- Network Monitoring: Wireshark

# :crossed_swords: Simulated Attacks

- Port Scanning (Nmap)
- Brute Force Attack (Hydra)
- Exploitation via Metasploit
- Reverse Shell Access

# :bar_chart: Log Analysis & Detection

Created detection rules for:
- Failed login attempts
- Suspicious source IP activity
- Port scanning behavior
- Reverse shell indicators

# :rotating_light: Incident Response

Generated a detailed incident response report including:
- Attack timeline
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Log evidence
- Risk assessment
- Mitigation strategies

# :dart: Skills Demonstrated

- Log Analysis
- SIEM Monitoring
- Threat Detection
- Incident Investigation
- Security Reporting
- Network Traffic Analysis

This project was built to simulate real-world SOC analyst responsibilities including monitoring, detection, and incident response.
